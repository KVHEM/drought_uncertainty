we explore a strategy for long-range hydrologic forecasting that uses ensemble climate model forecasts as input to a macroscale hydrologic model to produce runoff and streamflow forecasts at spatial and temporal scales appropriate for water management [WOOD 2002 | J. GEOPHYS. RES.-ATMOS. | 395]
 monthly ensemble climate model forecasts produced by the national centers for environmental prediction/climate prediction center global spectral model (gsm) are bias corrected, downscaled to 1/8degrees horizontal resolution, and disaggregated to a daily time step for input to the variable infiltration capacity hydrologic model [WOOD 2002 | J. GEOPHYS. RES.-ATMOS. | 395]
 the monthly meteorological forecasts are then interpolated to the finer hydrologic model scale, at which a daily signal that preserves the forecast anomaly is imposed through resampling of the historic record [WOOD 2002 | J. GEOPHYS. RES.-ATMOS. | 395]
 for the summer 2000 study period, persistence in anomalous initial hydrologic states predominates in determining the hydrologic forecasts [WOOD 2002 | J. GEOPHYS. RES.-ATMOS. | 395]
 in contrast, the el nino-condition hydrologic forecasts derive direction both from the climate model forecast signal and the antecedent land surface state [WOOD 2002 | J. GEOPHYS. RES.-ATMOS. | 395]
 from a qualitative standpoint the hydrologic forecasting strategy appears successful in translating climate forecast signals to hydrologic variables of interest for water management [WOOD 2002 | J. GEOPHYS. RES.-ATMOS. | 395]
 in addition to increasing variance, the interactions with the soil introduce a year-to-year memory in the hydrological cycle [SCHUBERT 2004 | J. CLIM. | 2121]
 over regions where there is considerable consistency among the analyzed models in predicting the sign of soil moisture changes, there is a wide range of magnitudes of the soil moisture response, indicating a high degree of model dependency in terrestrial hydrological sensitivity [WANG 2005 | CLIM. DYN. | 185]
four physically based land surface hydrology models driven by a common observation-based 3-hourly meteorological dataset were used to simulate soil moisture over china for the period 1950-2006 [WANG 2011 | J. CLIM. | 123]
 yet, despite the passage of almost 50 years since the development of the first computerized hydrologic simulation models and over 30 years since the development of hydrologic ensemble forecast methods, the prevalent method used for forecasting seasonal streamflow in the western united states remains the regression of spring and summer streamflow volume on spring snowpack and/or the previous winter's accumulated precipitation [WOOD 2006 | BULL. AMER. METEOROL. SOC. | 115]
 we describe an experimental streamflow forecast system for the western united states that applies a modern macroscale land surface model (akin to those now used in numerical weather prediction and climate models) to capture hydrologic states (soil moisture and snow) at the time of forecast, incorporates data assimilation methods to improve estimates of initial state, and uses a range of climate prediction ensembles to produce ensemble forecasts of streamflow and associated hydrologic states for lead times of up to one year [WOOD 2006 | BULL. AMER. METEOROL. SOC. | 115]
 the authors find a prominent surface heating and a weakening of the hydrological cycle over most of tropical africa, resulting in enhanced heat stress and extended dry spells [PAETH 2009 | J. CLIM. | 106]
retrospectively simulated soil moisture from an ensemble of six land surface/hydrological models was used to reconstruct drought events over the continental united states for the period 1920-2003 [WANG 2009 | J. CLIM. | 87]
 the results provide some insights into how a hydrological nowcast system can be developed, and also early results from a test application within the university of washington's real-time national surface water monitor and a review of the multimodel nowcasts during the southeastern drought beginning in summer 2007 are included [WANG 2009 | J. CLIM. | 87]
 increased irrigation demands, rule curves dictated by increased need for flood storage and downscaled projections of streamflow from the ensemble of gcms and scenarios are used for projecting future hydrologic scenarios [RAJE 2010 | ADV. WATER RESOUR. | 76]
 however, the wealth of data from satellites and recent advancements in large-scale hydrological modeling and seasonal climate model predictions have enabled the development of state-of-the-art monitoring and prediction systems that can help address many of the problems inherent to developing regions [SHEFFIELD 2014 | BULL. AMER. METEOROL. SOC. | 69]
 the predictive element takes downscaled ensemble dynamical climate forecasts and provides, when merged with the hydrological modeling, ensemble hydrological forecasts [SHEFFIELD 2014 | BULL. AMER. METEOROL. SOC. | 69]
 the contribution of individual storage components to total tws is investigated by using ensemble hydrological simulations with river routing [KIM 2009 | GEOPHYS. RES. LETT. | 61]
comparison of multiple hydrologic indicators, derived from independent data sources and modeling approaches, may improve confidence in signals of emerging drought, particularly during periods of rapid onset [ANDERSON 2013 | J. HYDROMETEOROL. | 57]
 the assessment uses adaptive decision model being developed for planning and operational management of the northern california (central valley) water resources system (hrc-gwri, 2007), coupled with a dynamic downscaling and hydrologic modeling system described in georgakakos et al [GEORGAKAKOS 2012 | J. HYDROL. | 57]
 the assessment process compares the water system response in four simulated scenarios, pertaining to two management policies (traditional and adaptive) and two hydrologic data sets (one for the historical and a second for a future scenario) [GEORGAKAKOS 2012 | J. HYDROL. | 57]
 the assessments show that the current policy, which is tuned to the historical hydrologic regime, is unable to cope effectively with the more variable future climate [GEORGAKAKOS 2012 | J. HYDROL. | 57]
 by contrast, the adaptive policy maintains similar performance under both hydrologic scenarios, suggesting that adaptive management constitutes an effective mitigation measure to climate change [GEORGAKAKOS 2012 | J. HYDROL. | 57]
 hydrology resulting from greenhouse gas increases during the twenty-first century [COOK 2008 | J. CLIM. | 54]
 the simulated differences in the midwest circulation and hydrology in the spring for the twenty-first century are similar to the observed moisture balance and circulation anomalies for may and, especially, june of 1993, a year of devastating floods throughout the mississippi valley [COOK 2008 | J. CLIM. | 54]
 grace data assimilation led to improved runoff estimates (in temporal correlation and root mean square error) in 17 out of 18 hydrological basins, even in basins smaller than the effective resolution of grace [LI 2012 | J. HYDROL. | 53]
seasonal hydrologic forecasts derive their skill from knowledge of initial hydrologic conditions and climate forecast skill associated with seasonal climate outlooks [SHUKLA 2011 | HYDROL. EARTH SYST. SCI. | 50]
 depending on the type of hydrological regime and the season, the relative contributions of initial hydrologic conditions and climate forecast skill to seasonal hydrologic forecast skill vary [SHUKLA 2011 | HYDROL. EARTH SYST. SCI. | 50]
 we constructed two experiments - ensemble streamflow prediction and reverse-ensemble streamflow prediction - to partition the contributions of the initial hydrologic conditions and climate forecast skill to overall forecast skill [SHUKLA 2011 | HYDROL. EARTH SYST. SCI. | 50]
 in ensemble streamflow prediction (first experiment) hydrologic forecast skill is derived solely from knowledge of initial hydrologic conditions, whereas in reverse-ensemble streamflow prediction (second experiment), it is derived solely from atmospheric forcings (i [SHUKLA 2011 | HYDROL. EARTH SYST. SCI. | 50]
 using the ratios of root mean square error in predicting cumulative runoff and mean monthly soil moisture of each experiment, we identify the variability of the relative contributions of the initial hydrologic conditions and climate forecast skill spatially throughout the year [SHUKLA 2011 | HYDROL. EARTH SYST. SCI. | 50]
 we conclude that the initial hydrologic conditions generally have the strongest influence on the prediction of cumulative runoff and soil moisture at lead-1 (first month of the forecast period), beyond which climate forecast skill starts to have greater influence [SHUKLA 2011 | HYDROL. EARTH SYST. SCI. | 50]
 improvement in climate forecast skill alone will lead to better seasonal hydrologic forecast skill in most parts of the northeastern and southeastern us throughout the year and in the western us mainly during fall and winter months; whereas improvement in knowledge of the initial hydrologic conditions can potentially improve skill most in the western us during spring and summer months [SHUKLA 2011 | HYDROL. EARTH SYST. SCI. | 501]
 lead-1) contribution of the initial hydrologic conditions in soil moisture forecasts is more extensive than in cumulative runoff forecasts across the conterminous us [SHUKLA 2011 | HYDROL. EARTH SYST. SCI. | 501]
[1] hydrologic implications of global climate change are usually [GHOSH 2007 | WATER RESOUR. RES. | 5]
skillful seasonal hydrologic predictions are useful in managing water resources, preparing for droughts and their impacts, energy planning, and many other related sectors [LUO 2008 | J. HYDROMETEOROL. | 46]
 in this study, a seasonal hydrologic ensemble prediction system is developed and evaluated over the eastern united states, with a focus on the ohio river basin [LUO 2008 | J. HYDROMETEOROL. | 46]
 the system uses a hydrologic model (i [LUO 2008 | J. HYDROMETEOROL. | 46]
 simultaneously, climate model forecasts are downscaled to an appropriate spatial scale for hydrologic predictions [LUO 2008 | J. HYDROMETEOROL. | 46]
 seasonal hydrologic predictions are made with this system, using seasonal climate forecast from the ncep climate forecast system (cfs), and from a combination of the ncep cfs and seven climate models in the european union's development of a european multimodel ensemble system for seasonal-to-interannual prediction (cfs + demeter) [LUO 2008 | J. HYDROMETEOROL. | 461]
 this study validates the approach of using seasonal climate predictions from dynamic climate models in hydrological predictions, and it also emphasizes the need for international collaborations to develop multimodel seasonal predictions [LUO 2008 | J. HYDROMETEOROL. | 461]
 projected changes to precipitation and temperature are derived from an ensemble of 6 regional climate models (rcms) run for the period 2071-2100 under the sres a2 emissions scenario and are subsequently bias corrected before input into a hydrological model [MAJONE 2012 | WATER RESOUR. RES. | 42]
 the use of rcm ensembles is important for the incorporation of uncertainties derived from different model structures, parameterizations and boundary conditions into the hydrological modeling process and subsequent climate change impact assessment [MAJONE 2012 | WATER RESOUR. RES. | 42]
 hydrological simulations using the geotransf model, with the climate change scenarios as input, show that projected water availability for the gallego is lower for the 2071-2100 period than for 1961-1990, with an increasing number of dry years [MAJONE 2012 | WATER RESOUR. RES. | 42]
this paper investigates the impact of climate change on drought by addressing two questions: (1) how reliable is the assessment of climate change impact on drought based on state-of-the-art climate change projections and downscaling techniques? and (2) will the impact be at the same level from meteorological, agricultural, and hydrologic perspectives? regional climate change projections based on dynamical downscaling through regional climate models (rcms) are used to assess drought frequency, intensity, and duration, and the impact propagation from meteorological to agricultural to hydrological systems [WANG 2011 | WATER RESOUR. RES. | 38]
 the climate projections are fed to a calibrated hydro-agronomic model at the watershed scale in central illinois, and agricultural drought indexed by the standardized soil water index (sswi) and hydrological drought by the standardized runoff index (sri) and crop yield impacts are assessed [WANG 2011 | WATER RESOUR. RES. | 38]
 the climate change impact on drought in terms of intensity, frequency, and duration grows from meteorological to agricultural to hydrological drought, especially for ccsm3-rcm [WANG 2011 | WATER RESOUR. RES. | 38]
 significant changes of sswi and sri are found because of the temperature increase and precipitation decrease during the crop season, as well as the nonlinear hydrological response to precipitation and temperature change [WANG 2011 | WATER RESOUR. RES. | 381]
 the standardized streamflow index (ssi) is used to characterize hydrologic droughts with different severities across the gunnison river basin in the upper colorado river basin [MADADGAR 2013 | J. HYDROMETEOROL. | 36]
 since streamflow, and subsequently hydrologic droughts, are autocorrelated variables in time, this study presents a multivariate probabilistic approach using copula functions to perform drought forecasting within a bayesian framework [MADADGAR 2013 | J. HYDROMETEOROL. | 36]
 incorporating copula functions into the bayesian framework, two different forecast models are established to estimate the hydrologic drought of spring given either the previous winter (first-order conditional model) or previous winter and fall (second-order conditional model) [MADADGAR 2013 | J. HYDROMETEOROL. | 36]
the accurate knowledge of soil moisture and snow conditions is important for the skillful characterization of agricultural and hydrologic droughts, which are defined as deficits of soil moisture and streamflow, respectively [KUMAR 2014 | J. HYDROMETEOROL. | 34]
simulated soil moisture is increasingly used to characterize agricultural droughts but its parametric uncertainty, which essentially affects all hydrological fluxes and state variables, is rarely considered for identifying major drought events [SAMANIEGO 2013 | J. HYDROMETEOROL. | 33]
 in this study, a high-resolution, 200-member ensemble of land surface hydrology simulations obtained with the mesoscale hydrologic model is used to investigate the effects of the parametric uncertainty on drought statistics such as duration, extension, and severity [SAMANIEGO 2013 | J. HYDROMETEOROL. | 33]
 simulated daily soil moisture fields over germany at the spatial resolution of 4 x 4 km(2) from 1950 to 2010 are used to derive a hydrologically consistent soil moisture index (smi) representing the monthly soil water quantile at every grid cell [SAMANIEGO 2013 | J. HYDROMETEOROL. | 33]
global seasonal hydrologic prediction is crucial to mitigating the impacts of droughts and floods, especially in the developing world [SHUKLA 2013 | HYDROL. EARTH SYST. SCI. | 33]
 hydrologic predictability at seasonal lead times (i [SHUKLA 2013 | HYDROL. EARTH SYST. SCI. | 33]
, 1-6 months) comes from knowledge of initial hydrologic conditions (ihcs) and seasonal climate forecast skill (fs) [SHUKLA 2013 | HYDROL. EARTH SYST. SCI. | 33]
 in this study we quantify the contributions of two primary components of ihcs - soil moisture and snow water content - and fs (of precipitation and temperature) to seasonal hydrologic predictability globally on a relative basis throughout the year [SHUKLA 2013 | HYDROL. EARTH SYST. SCI. | 33]
 we do so by conducting two model-based experiments using the variable infiltration capacity (vic) macroscale hydrology model, one based on ensemble streamflow prediction (esp) and another based on reverse-esp (rev-esp), both for a 47 yr re-forecast period (1961-2007) [SHUKLA 2013 | HYDROL. EARTH SYST. SCI. | 33]
 we compare cumulative runoff (cr), soil moisture (sm) and snow water equivalent (swe) forecasts from each experiment with a vic model-based reference data set (generated using observed atmospheric forcings) and estimate the ratio of root mean square error (rmse) of both experiments for each forecast initialization date and lead time, to determine the relative contribution of ihcs and fs to the seasonal hydrologic predictability [SHUKLA 2013 | HYDROL. EARTH SYST. SCI. | 33]
 we find that in general, the contributions of ihcs to seasonal hydrologic predictability is highest in the arid and snow-dominated climate (high latitude) regions of the northern hemisphere during forecast periods starting on 1 january and 1 october [SHUKLA 2013 | HYDROL. EARTH SYST. SCI. | 33]
 based on our findings, we argue that despite the limited fs (mainly for precipitation) better estimates of the ihcs could lead to improvement in the current level of seasonal hydrologic forecast skill over many regions of the globe at least during some parts of the year [SHUKLA 2013 | HYDROL. EARTH SYST. SCI. | 331]
one of the most significant anticipated consequences of global climate change is the increased frequency of hydrologic extremes [CUNDERLIK 2007 | HYDROL. PROCESS. | 30]
 predictions of climate change impacts on the regime of hydrologic extremes have traditionally been conducted using a top-down approach [CUNDERLIK 2007 | HYDROL. PROCESS. | 30]
 this study attempts to explore an inverse approach to the modelling of hydrologic risk and vulnerability to changing climatic conditions [CUNDERLIK 2007 | HYDROL. PROCESS. | 30]
 with a focus targeted at end-users, the proposed approach first identifies critical hydrologic exposures that may lead to local failures of existing water resources systems [CUNDERLIK 2007 | HYDROL. PROCESS. | 30]
 a hydrologic model is used to transform inversely the main hydrologic exposures, such as floods and droughts, into corresponding meteorological conditions [CUNDERLIK 2007 | HYDROL. PROCESS. | 30]
hydrological drought is increasingly studied using large-scale models [VAN 2012 | HYDROL. EARTH SYST. SCI. | 29]
 it is, however, not sure whether large-scale models reproduce the development of hydrological drought correctly [VAN 2012 | HYDROL. EARTH SYST. SCI. | 29]
 the pressing question is how well do large-scale models simulate the propagation from meteorological to hydrological drought? to answer this question, we evaluated the simulation of drought propagation in an ensemble mean of ten large-scale models, both land-surface models and global hydrological models, that participated in the model intercomparison project of watch (watermip) [VAN 2012 | HYDROL. EARTH SYST. SCI. | 29]
 for a selection of case study areas, we studied drought characteristics (number of droughts, duration, severity), drought propagation features (pooling, attenuation, lag, lengthening), and hydrological drought typology (classical rainfall deficit drought, rain-to-snow-season drought, wet-to-dry-season drought, cold snow season drought, warm snow season drought, composite drought) [VAN 2012 | HYDROL. EARTH SYST. SCI. | 29]
 drought events became fewer and longer when moving through the hydrological cycle [VAN 2012 | HYDROL. EARTH SYST. SCI. | 29]
 this fast reaction to precipitation, even in cold climates in winter and in semi-arid climates in summer, also greatly influenced the hydrological drought typology as identified by the large-scale models [VAN 2012 | HYDROL. EARTH SYST. SCI. | 291]
 this leads to a high uncertainty in hydrological drought simulation at large scales [VAN 2012 | HYDROL. EARTH SYST. SCI. | 291]
 improvement of drought simulation in large-scale models should focus on a better representation of hydrological processes that are important for drought development, such as evapotranspiration, snow accumulation and melt, and especially storage [VAN 2012 | HYDROL. EARTH SYST. SCI. | 291]
 downscaled temperature and precipitation projections from 16 global climate models (gcms), using two emission scenarios (b1 and a2), were used to drive a calibrated soil and water assessment tool (swat) hydrologic model to assess the effects on streamflow on the two significant inflows to the mlb, lee vining and rush creeks [FICKLIN 2013 | CLIM. CHANGE | 28]
 swat modeling results suggest a significant hydrologic response in the mlb by the end of the century that includes a) decreases in annual streamflow by 15 \% compared to historical conditions b) an advance of the peak snowmelt runoff to 1 month earlier (june to may), c) a decreased (10-15 \%) occurrence of `wet' hydrologic years, and d) and more frequent (7-22 \%) drought conditions [FICKLIN 2013 | CLIM. CHANGE | 28]
 in this study, surface and subsurface runoff generated by the 13 land surface schemes (lsss) participating in the second global soil wetness project (gswp-2) are used as input fields for the hydrology discharge (hd) routing model to simulate discharge for 30 of the world's largest rivers [MATERIA 2010 | J.

the identification of hydrological drought at global scale has received considerable attention during the last decade [VAN 2012 | HYDROL. EARTH SYST. SCI. | 24]
climate change is expected to have a significant impact on the hydrologic cycle, creating changes in freshwater resources [TSANIS 2011 | CLIM. CHANGE | 24]
we investigate future (2045-2054) hydrological cycle of the snow fed oglio (approximate to 1800 km(2)) alpine watershed in northern italy [GROPPELLI 2011 | NAT. HAZARDS EARTH SYST. SCI. | 24]
 then, we feed the downscaled fields to a minimal hydrological model to build future hydrological scenarios [GROPPELLI 2011 | NAT. HAZARDS EARTH SYST. SCI. | 24]
 we then assess the degree of uncertainty, or spread, of the projected water resources scenarios by feeding the hydrological model with ensembles projections consistent with our deterministic (gcms + loc) scenarios, and we evaluate the significance of the projected flow variables against those observed in the control run [GROPPELLI 2011 | NAT. HAZARDS EARTH SYST. SCI. | 24]
 the climate scenarios from the adopted gcms differ greatly from one another with respect to projected precipitation amount and temperature regimes, and so do the projected hydrological scenarios [GROPPELLI 2011 | NAT. HAZARDS EARTH SYST. SCI. | 24]
 a relatively good agreement is found upon prospective shrinkage and shorter duration of the seasonal snow cover due to increased temperature patterns, and upon prospective increase of hydrological losses, i [GROPPELLI 2011 | NAT. HAZARDS EARTH SYST. SCI. | 24]
 the proposed hydrological scenarios eventually provide a what-if analysis, giving a broad view of the possible expected impacts of climate change within the italian alps, necessary to trigger the discussion about future adaptation strategies [GROPPELLI 2011 | NAT. HAZARDS EARTH SYST. SCI. | 241]
this study explores the performance of a suite of off-line, global (hydrological and land surface) models in mapping spatial and temporal patterns of large-scale hydrological droughts in europe from simulated runoff in the period 1963-2000 [TALLAKSEN 2014 | GEOPHYS. RES. LETT. | 23]
 the high model dispersion in temporal and spatial persistence of drought identified implies that care should be taken when analyzing drought characteristics from only one or a limited number of models unless validated specifically for hydrological drought [TALLAKSEN 2014 | GEOPHYS. RES. LETT. | 23]

 finally, the indicator of hydrologic alteration was applied to carry out a quantitative analysis and assessment of the impact of climate change on runoff, the river flow regime, and the aquatic ecosystem [KIM 2011 | HYDROL. PROCESS. | 21]
 the amount of the minimum discharge over various durations tended to increase when compared to the present hydrological condition [KIM 2011 | HYDROL. PROCESS. | 211]
climate-model-based seasonal hydrologic forecasting (cm-shf) is an emerging area in recent decade because of the development of coupled atmosphere-ocean-land general circulation models (cgcms) and land surface hydrologic models, and increasing needs for transferring the advances in climate research into hydrologic applications within the framework of climate services [YUAN 2015 | WILEY INTERDISCIP. REV.-WATER | 20]
 in order to forecast terrestrial hydrology from monthly to seasonal time scales, a cm-shf system should take advantage of important information from initial land surface conditions (ics) as well as skillful seasonal predictions of atmospheric boundary conditions that mostly rely on the predictability of large-scale climate precursors such as the el nino southern oscillation (enso) [YUAN 2015 | WILEY INTERDISCIP. REV.-WATER | 20]
 the progresses in the understanding of seasonal hydrologic predictability in terms of ics and climate precursors are reviewed, and future emphases are discussed [YUAN 2015 | WILEY INTERDISCIP. REV.-WATER | 20]
 both the achievements and challenges of the cm-shf system development, including multimodel ensemble prediction, seamless hydrologic forecasting, dynamical downscaling, hydrologic post-processing, and seasonal forecasting of hydrologic extremes with the hyper-resolution modeling framework that is able to address both the climate change and water resources management impacts on terrestrial hydrology, are presented [YUAN 2015 | WILEY INTERDISCIP. REV.-WATER | 20]
 regardless of great strides in cm-shf, a grand challenge is the effective dissemination of the information provided by the seasonal hydrologic forecasting system to the decision-makers, which cannot be resolved without cross-disciplinary dialog and collaboration [YUAN 2015 | WILEY INTERDISCIP. REV.-WATER | 20]
 it is an open question whether these models are suitable to capture hydrological drought, in terms of runoff, on a global scale [VAN 2013 | J. HYDROMETEOROL. | 18]
 time series of monthly precipitation, monthly total runoff from 10 global hydrological models, and their ensemble median have been used to identify drought [VAN 2013 | J. HYDROMETEOROL. | 18]
 some models showed a fast runoff response to rainfall, which led to deviations from reported drought events in slowly responding hydrological systems [VAN 2013 | J. HYDROMETEOROL. | 181]
under a warming climate, changes in hydrological extremes may be more significant than changes in hydrological mean conditions [HUANG 2015 | REG. ENVIR. CHANG. | 17]
 due to the high risk of damage and the increasing trends of floods and droughts in germany, the potential changes in hydrological extreme events are of high importance [HUANG 2015 | REG. ENVIR. CHANG. | 17]

 results from the dtf papers indicate that key successes for drought monitoring include the application of modern land surface hydrological models that can be used for objective drought analysis, including extended retrospective forcing datasets to support hydrologic reanalyses, and the expansion of near-real-time satellite-based monitoring and analyses, particularly those describing vegetation and evapotranspiration [WOOD 2015 | J.

 seasonal hydrologic extremes in the form of droughts and wet spells have devastating impacts on human and natural systems [YUAN 2015 | BULL. AMER. METEOROL. SOC. | 15]
 improving understanding and predictive capability of hydrologic extremes, and facilitating adaptations through establishing climate service systems at regional to global scales are among the grand challenges proposed by the world climate research programme (wcrp) and are the core themes of the regional hydroclimate projects (rhp) under the global energy and water cycle experiment (gewex) [YUAN 2015 | BULL.

 an experimental global seasonal hydrologic forecasting system has been developed that is based on coupled climate forecast models participating in the north american multimodel ensemble (nmme) project and an advanced land surface hydrologic model [YUAN 2015 | BULL. AMER. METEOROL. SOC. | 15]
 the association of the onset of extreme hydrologic events with oceanic and land precursors is also investigated based on the joint distribution of forecasts and observations [YUAN 2015 | BULL. AMER. METEOROL. SOC. | 15]
 climate models have a higher probability of missing the onset of hydrologic extremes when there is no oceanic precursor [YUAN 2015 | BULL. AMER. METEOROL. SOC. | 15]
 this study is targeted at providing the scientific underpinning for the predictability of hydrologic extremes over gewex rhp basins and serves as a prototype for seasonal hydrologic forecasts within the global framework for climate services (gfcs) [YUAN 2015 | BULL. AMER. METEOROL. SOC. | 151]
 while drought is generally a consequence of atmospheric anomalies, the impacts to society are more directly related to hydrologic conditions [JOETZJER 2013 | HYDROL. EARTH SYST. SCI. | 15]
 only 12-month duration droughts are considered in order to allow a direct (no river routing) comparison between meteorological anomalies and their hydrological counterpart [JOETZJER 2013 | HYDROL. EARTH SYST. SCI. | 15]
 these results suggest that empirical meteorological drought indices should be considered with great caution in a warming climate and that more physical water balance models are needed to account for the impact of the anthropogenic radiative forcings on hydrological droughts [JOETZJER 2013 | HYDROL. EARTH SYST. SCI. | 15]

 these distributed meteorological reconstructions were used as inputs to the variable infiltration capacity (vic) hydrologic model over the yakima basin to produce an ensemble of warm season streamflows for each reconstructed year [LUTZ 2012 | WATER RESOUR. RES. | 12]
despite the fact that global climate model (gcm) outputs have been used to project hydrologic impacts of climate change using off-line hydrologic models for two decades, many of these efforts have been disjointed - applications or at least calibrations have been focused on individual river basins and using a few of the available gcms [NAZ 2016 | GLOB.

 associated with these hydrological changes are substantial increases in the frequency and the intensity of both drier conditions and flooding events [PAGAN 2016 | ENVIRON. RES. LETT. | 3]
 climate change has also a direct hydrological impact, and increasing efforts have focused on understanding the hydrological dynamics at continental and subregional scales, such as the western amazon [ZULKAFLI 2016 | ENVIRON. RES. LETT. | 3]
 here we use a distributed land surface model to quantify the potential impact of this change in the climate on the hydrological regime of the upper amazon river [ZULKAFLI 2016 | ENVIRON. RES. LETT. | 3]
to date, the majority of hydrological forecasting studies have focussed on using medium-range (3 15 days) weather forecasts to drive hydrological models and make predictions of future river flows [MACKAY 2015 | J. HYDROL. | 3]
 we combine empirical relationships between modeled land surface wetness and the incidence of human clinical cases of sle and modeled land surface wetness and the occurrence of sle virus transmission throughout south florida with a previously developed method for generating ensemble, seasonal hydrologic forecasts [SHAMAN 2006 | CLIM. CHANGE | 3]
 these ensembles were then used to force an ensemble of five hydrological models and changes to hydrological indicators were calculated [DONNELLY 2017 | CLIM. CHANGE | 2]
 in a warmer world, the hydrological impacts of climate change are more intense and spatially more extensive [DONNELLY 2017 | CLIM. CHANGE | 2]
 the novelty of this study is to seek the use of data assimilation to quantify initial condition uncertainty with the monte carlo ensemble members, rather than relying entirely on the hydrologic model or land surface model to generate a single deterministic initial condition, as currently implemented in the operational drought forecasting systems [YAN 2017 | J. HYDROL. | 2]
 while short to sub-seasonal prediction systems and forecast products are available, a skilful hydrologic forecast of runoff and root-zone soil moisture that can provide timely information has been lacking in india [SHAH 2017 | HYDROL. EARTH SYST. SCI. | 2]
 using precipitation and air temperature forecasts from the climate forecast system v2 (cfsv2), the global ensemble forecast system (gefsv2) and four products from the indian institute of tropical meteorology (iitm), here we show that the iitm ensemble mean (mean of all four products from the iitm) can be used operationally to provide a hydrologic forecast in india at a 7-45-day accumulation period [SHAH 2017 | HYDROL. EARTH SYST. SCI. | 2]
 hydrological modellers are tasked with understanding and minimising the uncertainty surrounding streamflow predictions before communicating the overall uncertainty to decision makers [MOCKLER 2016 | ADV. WATER RESOUR. | 2]
 the analysis illustrates that, for our subjective choices, hydrological model selection had a greater contribution to overall uncertainty, while performance criteria selection influenced the relative intra-annual uncertainties in streamflow predictions [MOCKLER 2016 | ADV. WATER RESOUR. | 2]
global land surface hydrology and heat fluxes can be estimated by running a land surface model (lsm) driven by the atmospheric forcing dataset [WANG 2016 | J. HYDROMETEOROL. | 2]
 the simulated monthly surface hydrology variables, fluxes, and the forcing datasets were then evaluated against various observation-based datasets (soil moisture, runoff, snow depth and water equivalent, and flux tower measurements) [WANG 2016 | J. HYDROMETEOROL. | 21]
medium-range (similar to 7 days) forecasts of agricultural and hydrologic droughts can help in decision-making in agriculture and water resources management [SHAH 2016 | J. HYDROMETEOROL. | 2]
 india has witnessed severe losses due to extreme weather events during recent years and medium-range forecasts of precipitation, air temperatures (maximum and minimum), and hydrologic variables (root-zone soil moisture and runoff) can be valuable [SHAH 2016 | J. HYDROMETEOROL. | 2]
 the results showed that because of high persistence, medium-range soil moisture forecasts are largely determined by the initial hydrologic conditions [SHAH 2016 | J. HYDROMETEOROL. | 21]
 bias correction of precipitation and temperature forecasts does not lead to significant improvement in the medium-range hydrologic forecasting of soil moisture and drought [SHAH 2016 | J. HYDROMETEOROL. | 21]
 based on results from the xxt (the first x denotes xinanjiang, the second x denotes hybrid, and the t denotes topmodel) distributed hydrological model, as well as soil moisture observations and digital elevation model (dem) data, synthesized drought grades were established in the huaihe river basin of china [ZHAO 2016 | SCI. TOTAL ENVIRON. | 2]
post-processing has received much attention during the last couple of years within the hydrological community, and many different methods have been developed and tested, especially in the field of flood forecasting [BOGNER 2016 | WATER | 2]
the central united states experiences a wide array of hydrological extremes, with the 1993, 2008, 2013, and 2014 flooding events and the 1988 and 2012 droughts representing some of the most recent extremes, and is an area where water availability is critical for agricultural production [GIUNTOLI 2015 | J. GEOPHYS. RES.-ATMOS. | 2]
 this study aims to evaluate the ability of a set of global impact models (gims) from the water model intercomparison project to reproduce the regional hydrology of the central united states for the period 1963-2001 [GIUNTOLI 2015 | J. GEOPHYS. RES.-ATMOS. | 2]
 hydrological indices describing annual daily maximum, medium and minimum flow, and their timing are extracted from both modeled daily runoff data by nine gims and from observed daily streamflow measured at 252 river gauges [GIUNTOLI 2015 | J. GEOPHYS. RES.-ATMOS. | 2]
 overall, this study provides a valuable examination of the capability of gims to reproduce observed regional hydrology over a range of quantities for the central united states [GIUNTOLI 2015 | J. GEOPHYS. RES.-ATMOS. | 21]
 how the quality of the meteorological forcing of a hydrological model affects the hydrological response during streamflow droughts was explored in case studies of two swiss rivers: the thur, which is mainly rain-fed and the landquart, which is dominantly snow-fed [JOERG 2015 | METEOROL. APPL. | 2]
 the existing drought indices can hardly capture the drought features in this region as droughts are caused by two dominant factors (meteorological and hydrological conditions) [YANG 2015 | HYDROL. PROCESS. | 2]
 to overcome the problem, a new hybrid drought index (hdi), integrating the meteorological and hydrological drought regimes, was developed and tested in the basin in the work [YANG 2015 | HYDROL. PROCESS. | 2]
 the index succeeded in revealing the drought characteristics and the ensemble influence better than the single standardized precipitation index or the hydrological index [YANG 2015 | HYDROL. PROCESS. | 2]
 each factor was evaluated in a hydrologic context; for instance, exposure was interpreted as a change in surface runoff [RIVAS 2014 | J. WATER RESOUR. PLAN. MANAGE.-ASCE | 2]
 factors were combined using a geographic information system (gis), and an overall methodology was proposed to map hydrologic vulnerability [RIVAS 2014 | J. WATER RESOUR. PLAN. MANAGE.-ASCE | 2]
 three scenarios were run on the large scale model: the first simulating mean hydrological conditions and the other two simulating one standard deviation above and below the mean hydrological conditions [MASTROCICCO 2014 | J. WATER CLIM. CHANG. | 2]
 in the present study we use hydrological modelling to quantify the volume of the deficit discharges as projected by an ensemble of transient regional climate model simulations [HANEL 2013 | NA | 2]
 projections are based on the soil and water assessment tool (swat) hydrological model simulations driven by results of the euro-cordex experiment under representative concentration pathways 4 [PINIEWSKI 2017 | HYDROL. PROCESS. | 1]
 there is an overall agreement of our findings for the vob region with projections of hydrological extremes from large-scale models forced by euro-cordex results in the european-scale studies [PINIEWSKI 2017 | HYDROL. PROCESS. | 11]
 here, we present an ensemble kalman filter (enkf) hydrologic data assimilation system that predicts bias in satellite soil moisture data to support the physically based soil moisture analytical relationship (smar) infiltration model, which estimates root zone soil moisture with satellite soil moisture data [BALDWIN 2017 | J. HYDROL. | 1]
climatic variability can lead to large-scale alterations in the hydrologic cycle, some of which can be characterized in terms of indices involving precipitation depth, duration and frequency [CHATTOPADHYAY 2017 | WATER | 1]
future climate change is expected to have wide ranging impacts on the hydrology of mountain rivers because of changes in the magnitudes and timing of rain and snow, as well as the significant spatial variability of topography and other catchment characteristics [CARUSO 2017 | RIVER RES. APPL. | 1]
 the topnet hydrological model was used to estimate catchment runoff and lake inflows based on the 1990s (baseline), 2040s, and 2090s periods [CARUSO 2017 | RIVER RES. APPL. | 1]
the change of hydrological regimes may cause impacts on human and natural system [SHIN 2016 | HYDROL. PROCESS. | 1]
 therefore, investigation of hydrologic alteration induced by climate change is essential for preparing timely proper adaptation to the changes [SHIN 2016 | HYDROL. PROCESS. | 1]
 using an ensemble of future hydrologic projections simulated by three conceptual rainfall-runoff models (gr4j, ihacres, and sacramento models), we calculated hydrologic alteration factors (hafs) to investigate degrees of variations in indicators of hydrologic alteration (ihas) derived from the hydrologic projections [SHIN 2016 | HYDROL. PROCESS. | 1]
 a wide range of hafs between rainfall-runoff models for each catchment was detected by large variations in the magnitude of hafs with the hydrologic models and the difference could be the hydrologic prediction uncertainty [SHIN 2016 | HYDROL. PROCESS. | 1]
 there were no-consistent tendency in the order of hafs between the hydrologic models [SHIN 2016 | HYDROL. PROCESS. | 11]
 in addition, we found that the alterations of hydrologic regimes by climate change are smaller as the size of catchment is larger [SHIN 2016 | HYDROL. PROCESS. | 11]
we investigate how to identify and assess teleconnection signals between anomalous patterns of sea surface temperature (sst) changes and climate variables related to hydrologic impacts over different river basins [TSAI 2015 | CLIM. DYN. | 1]
 here we present projected changes in the hydrologic cycle over a representative area of the american midwest from regional climate model experiments that sample a range of model configurations [WINTER 2015 | WATER RESOUR. RES. | 1]
 based on this analysis of model simulations and observations, we conclude that the sign of climate change impacts on the regional hydrology of the american midwest remains uncertain [WINTER 2015 | WATER RESOUR. RES. | 1]
 each factor was evaluated in a hydrologic context, for instance exposure was interpreted as a change in surface runoff [RIVAS 2013 | J. WATER CLIM. CHANG. | 1]
 factors were combined using a geographic information system (gis) and an overall methodology to map hydrologic vulnerability was proposed [RIVAS 2013 | J. WATER CLIM. CHANG. | 1]
 finally, overall hydrologic vulnerability maps were obtained to locate the most vulnerable regions, where precisely adaption efforts would be more necessary to sustain environmental conditions [RIVAS 2013 | J. WATER CLIM. CHANG. | 11]
 a water balance model (abcd) was successfully calibrated using a regional regression, including monthly and weekly factors, and was used to convert meteorology to hydrology [KIM 2012 | HYDROL. SCI. J.-J. SCI. HYDROL. | 1]
 it is explained that for extreme wet events the final objective would be to couple high-resolution meteorological and hydrological models, creating a ``meteohydrological chain'' [CASSARDO 2009 | NA | 1]
 drought risk assessment is complicated by the nonlinear interaction of the atmospheric hydrologic and oceanic systems where highly varied hydrologic system responses to similar drought-forcing phenomena can occur [ANDERSON 2000 | J. HYDROL. ENG. | 1]
 ensemble mean and standard deviations of hydrologic water storage represent the expected hydrologic system response to the hydroclimatic event [ANDERSON 2000 | J. HYDROL. ENG. | 1]
 relative frequency histograms and cumulative distribution functions characterize the range of hydrologic system responses that can occur and are used to obtain the spatially and temporally evolving drought risks [ANDERSON 2000 | J. HYDROL. ENG. | 1]
