 a separation of different sources of uncertainty in projections of meteorological and soil moisture drought reveals that for the near term, internal climate variability is the dominant source, while the formulation of global climate models (gcms) generally becomes the dominant source of spread by the end of the 21st century, especially for soil moisture drought [ORLOWSKY 2013 | HYDROL. EARTH SYST. SCI. | 96]
 in comparison, the uncertainty from green-house gas (ghg) concentrations scenarios is negligible for most regions [ORLOWSKY 2013 | HYDROL. EARTH SYST. SCI. | 961]

APPL. METEOROL. CLIMATOL. | 17]
 we find that the large differences between the models in soil moisture trends, which are related to an unknown combination of differences in atmospheric forcing (precipitation, net radiation), flux partitioning at the land surface, and how soil moisture is parameterized, imply considerable uncertainty in future changes in climate extremes [LORENZ 2016 | J.

 the dempster-shafer (d-s) evidence theory is used for representing and combining uncertainty from various sources [RAJE 2010 | ADV. WATER RESOUR. | 14]
 a significant advantage of the d-s framework over the traditional probabilistic approach is that it allows for the allocation of a probability mass to sets or intervals, and can hence handle both aleatory or stochastic uncertainty, and epistemic or subjective uncertainty [RAJE 2010 | ADV. WATER RESOUR. | 14]
 this paper shows how the d-s theory can be used to represent beliefs in some hypotheses such as hydrologic drought or wet conditions, describe uncertainty and ignorance in the system, and give a quantitative measurement of belief and plausibility in results [RAJE 2010 | ADV. WATER RESOUR. | 14]

HYDROL. | 4]
 since the uncorrected cfsv2 precipitation forecasts are characterized by a high uncertainty (up to 175\% of the observed variability), the quantile-quantile transformation can clearly reduce this overestimation with the potential to provide skillful and valuable early warnings of precipitation deficits and excess up to 6months in ahead, particularly for the sudan-sahel zone [SIEGMUND 2015 | J. GEOPHYS. RES.-ATMOS. | 4]
