 this study aims at assessing the merits and caveats of a statistical empirical method, the ensemble streamflow prediction system (esp, an ensemble based on reordering historical data) and an operational dynamical forecast system, the european centre for medium-range weather forecasts-system 4 (s4) in predicting summer drought in europe [TURCO 2017 | ENVIRON. RES. LETT. | 1]
 in the second part of the paper, a review of projections of low and high flows in rivers in central and eastern europe is presented [PINIEWSKI 2017 | HYDROL. PROCESS. | 1]
 there is an overall agreement of our findings for the vob region with projections of hydrological extremes from large-scale models forced by euro-cordex results in the european-scale studies [PINIEWSKI 2017 | HYDROL. PROCESS. | 11]
 in this paper we therefore analyse and compare the performance of the first month of the probabilistic extended range forecast and of the seasonal forecast from the european centre for medium-range weather forecasts (ecmwf) in predicting droughts over the european continent [LAVAYSSE 2015 | HYDROL. EARTH SYST. SCI. | 1]
 early season forecasts from the coupled forecast system (cfs) are steadier than european community medium range forecast (ecmwf) [JURY 2014 | ADV. METEOROL. | 1]
 the bias correction adjustments have been applied on precipitation and temperature from the european centre for middle-range weather forecasting system 4 (s4) [MARCOS 2018 | SCI. TOTAL ENVIRON. | 0]
