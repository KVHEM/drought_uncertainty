 in the usa, three distinct periods of widespread and persistent drought stand out in these records for the latter half of the nineteenth century: 1856-1865, 1870-1877 and 1890-1896 [HERWEIJER 2006 | HOLOCENE | 94]
 to examine the physical mechanisms behind these droughts two ensembles of simulations with an atmosphere general circulation model (agcm) were generated: the first forces an agcm with the observed history of sea surface temperatures (ssts) everywhere front 1856 to 2001 (the goga experiment), the second forces the agcm only with tropical pacific ssts, being coupled to a two-layer entraining mixed layer (m l) ocean elsewhere (the poga-ml experiment) [HERWEIJER 2006 | HOLOCENE | 94]
 precipitation is the primary driver of drought variability but anthropogenic warming is estimated to have accounted for 8-27\% of the observed drought anomaly in 2012-2014 and 5-18\% in 2014 [WILLIAMS 2015 | GEOPHYS. RES. LETT. | 79]
 these relationships are reasonably well reproduced in ensembles of atmosphere model simulations forced by historical sst for the period from 1856 to 2002 [SEAGER 2009 | ATMOSFERA | 73]

 drought in western north america during the 1850s-1860s, 1870s, 1890s, 1930s and 1950s, is shown to coincide with the occurrence of prolonged dry spells in parts of europe, southern south america and western australia [HERWEIJER 2008 | INT. J. CLIMATOL. | 27]

 to enable the separation by sst region of influence we use an ensemble of global atmospheric climate model simulations forced with historical, 1856-2006 full global ssts, and compare the results to two other simulations with historical ssts confined to the tropical atlantic and to the tropical indian ocean and pacific [CAMARGO 2013 | CLIM.
